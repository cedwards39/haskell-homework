This is the interview scaffold.

We have tried to incorporate all the main ways of using Haskell, cabal, stack
and nix.

The interviewee should receive a link to this repository together with the
problem statement.

## Using Nix

```console
$ nix-shell --run $SHELL
$ cabal build
```

## Using Cabal

```console
$ cabal build
```

## Using stack

```console
$ stack build
```

## Rules

- Don't remove/disable the tests
- Follow the problem statement
- Pretty much everything else is up to the interviewee, refactor code, modify cabal, add tests etc.
